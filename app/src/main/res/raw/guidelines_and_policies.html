Monkey also utilizes an algorithm to aid in removing suspicious reviews. If you feel your review
was deleted in error, email us at  <u>help@Greasemonkeyonline.in</u></p>

<br>

<h1>Biker Code of Conduct</h1>
<ul>
	<li><b>Keep out the clutter:</b> To make sure we collectively work towards building the highest-quality
content that's useful to everyone, reviews need to be a minimum of 140 characters long for
dine-in reviews.. That's just about the length of a tweet, so it's convenient even for all you
micro-bloggers. If you cover the Mechanic, service and ambiance, you shouldn't fall short on
characters. We do not have 140 characters limit for an online order review. However, if any
review is filled with junk, we might have to remove the review altogether.</li><br>
	
	<li><b>Keep it relevant:</b>Please keep your contributions relevant to Grease Monkey. Accounts placing
irrelevant, inappropriate, or promotional content, that solicit customers, or that spam service
centers, notice.or are based on any already disclaimed or informed policies and practices of a
service center may be deleted without notice. If your review has been removed or moderated
by us and if you re post another experience for the same service center, we reserve the right to
remove that review too, even though such review might be in line with our content guidelines.</li><br>
	
	<li><b>Keep it clean:</b>Whether you're writing a small snippet or a delightfully detailed account of your
experience, keep foul/abusive/hateful language, threats, and lewdness out of it. We, just like
you, hate junk and will delete it whenever we see it. This also includes (but is not limited to)
derogatory comments on someone's protected characteristics (e.g. race, gender, religion) or
indication of a personal vendetta against a business and its associates.</li><br>
	
	<li><b>Keep it fresh::</b>Only one review per service center for a self drop-in experience and one review
for each online order transaction can be submitted and your most recent experience at a place
counts. That's what is going to help people when they're trying to decide whether or not to avail
services there. You're free to edit and update your review based on subsequent visits at any
time. Reviews about old experiences (more than 6 months old) will also be deleted from our
platform.</li><br>
	
	<li><b>Keep it real:</b>Write your review based on facts and your own experiences (e.g. not a friend's or
any hearsay experience or based on media reports). Please don't exaggerate or falsify your
experience. We do not take sides in cases of dispute, so make sure you can stand by your
word. Content that indicates the reviewer hasn't even visited or availed any services from the
service center will be removed. For example, "Never been here, never want to. Management is
horrible and the Service is worse!" Deceptive, fake, or misleading reviews will be removed. 
Reviewing a bunch of service centers in quick succession (even if you availed services of them
more often than you should) is considered suspicious activity, and it's likely these reviews will
be moderated. Accepting or soliciting a kickback – monetary or otherwise – in exchange for
reviews or photographs is also not acceptable, and could result in removal of your profile.</li><br>
	
	<li><b>Don't solicit:</b>Identifying or promoting yourself as an official Grease monkey blogger, or using
your status to solicit any kind of benefits (including but not limited to accepting money, free
service) in exchange for promotion, or at the threat of negative reviews on Grease monkey, will
not be tolerated. If reports or evidence of such instances are brought to our attention, we
reserve the right to delete your Grease monkey profile or take any other action that we may
deem fit, no questions asked. Acts that constitute as 'Solicitation' include:
<br>
	<ul>
	<li>Explicit/Implied agreement (written or verbal) to write reviews in exchange for money, a free
service, etc.</li>
	<li>Being a part of social media groups (e.g. WhatsApp/Facebook or any other social media platform) which offer incentives in exchange of reviews.</li>
	</ul>
</li><br>
	<li><b>Don't steal:</b>Plagiarism is something we take seriously. Copying others' reviews or photos from
Grease monkey or other platforms,, or even re-posting your own in multiple places on Grease
monkey (in full or in part), is something that will not be tolerated and may be removed/
moderated.. We trust that you'll play fair and create your own content.</li><br>
	
	<li><b>Tell the whole story:</b>If you luck into a free service as a guest of the service center, or have a
relevant association with a service center or its owners, give full disclosure in your review.
We're sure that honesty is the best policy, and other users will respect you even more for it. If
you have made it to the major league as a service writer or critic, let us know and we can
provide special access for your blog link to appear with your reviews. We love summaries, but
incomplete reviews with a manually added link will be removed.</li><br>

<li><b>Be yourself:</b>Your profile is your identity on Grease Monkey, so keep it real. You're welcome to
use a screen name , but please refrain from using inappropriate names, bios, or profile images.
We want to stay clean, and we might end up removing your account depending on how
inappropriate your profile is.</li><br><br>
<li><b>Don't misrepresent:</b>Identifying or promoting yourself as an official Grease Monkey blogger, or
using your status to solicit benefits in exchange for promotion or at the threat of negative
reviews on Grease Monkey will not be tolerated. If reports or evidence of such instances are
brought to our attention, we reserve the right to delete your Grease Monkey profile, no
questions asked.</li><br>
<li><b>Don’t be a bully:</b>We take allegations of blackmail or threatening behavior against garages and
its associates very seriously. This activity is strictly against our guidelines and may also be
illegal in many locations. Reviews submitted in an attempt to blackmail a garage and its
associates will be deleted.</li><br>

<li><b>Play by the rules:</b>The content you add should be in compliance with GREASE MONKEY's
Terms and Conditions, including terms and conditions of any of GREASE MONKEY products
such as GREASE MONKEY Gold, Online Ordering, , as well as the prevailing local laws and
regulations. Local laws take precedence, and content may be moderated or deleted to adhere
to these.</li><br>
<li><b>Seek help from the right people:</b>GREASE MONKEY is a website and mobile application with
no claims to be a court of law or a ministry of health (we aren't serious enough to do those
jobs). If you have a dispute with a service center, or if you feel a service center does not
measure up to health codes, we encourage you to contact the appropriate authorities directly.
GREASE MONKEY is not the appropriate platform for reporting illegal activities, physical
confrontations, health code violations, or anything under investigation by local governing bodies
or law-enforcement personnel. We encourage that such accusations be reported to the
concerned authorities rather than being mentioned in reviews.</li><br>
 
</ul>

<h1>Photo guidelines</h1>


<p>There&#39;s no easier way to show how good the bike is serviced than with a picture, right? That
said, it&#39;s important to keep in mind our photo guidelines, and understand why some photos may
be moved or removed once they&#39;ve been added.</p>
<p>Bike shots that are clear and in focus enough to make the viewer wish GREASE MONKEY
included touch -n-feel will be featured in garage&#39; photo galleries. Ambiance shots that highlight
the overall feel or vibe of a place will also be highlighted on garage pages.</p>
<p>Photos that don&#39;t make the cut to appear on a garage&#39;s page, will show with your review or on
your profile depending on how useful it is to other users and how relevant it is to the review.
Photos with bugs will be shown only with a review for validation and context.</p>
<p>Violation of the below mentioned pointers may lead to deduction of points, reduced visibility or
deletion of your pictures</p>


<ul>
	<li>Photos that are exact duplicates of other photos, multiple clicks of the same Bike or ambiance
or taken from a different angles</li>
	<li>Plagiarized photos</li>
	<li>Photos of others posted without their permission</li>
	<li>Photos that contain promotional content</li>
	<li>Photos that contain subject such as people in it</li>
	<li>Photos that are blurry or unclear</li>
	<li>Photos that contain text, or are not related to Bike servicing</li>
	<li>Photos of half serviced bikes</li>
	<li>Photos containing watermarks or write-ups of any kind</li>
	<li>Photos containing and focusing on subjects other than bike or service center ambiance</li>

</ul>
